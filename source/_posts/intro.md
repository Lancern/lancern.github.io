Hi there. Welcome to Lancern's blog.

I'm currently a master student in NISL, Tsinghua University. I got my bachelor degree at Beijing Institute of Technology.

My research interests include fuzzing and vulnerability discovery.

I was an ICPC candidate and now I'm learning CTF-related stuff.

You can reach me by [msr20@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn](mailto:msr20@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn).

Happy hacking and wish you a nice day!
